# Align Inline Comments

A Visual Studio Code extension for aligning the inline trailing comments after code.

This extension aligns inline comments to the rightmost position. It only aligns inline comments placed after the code. Inline comments standing alone on a line will not be aligned. The space between the end of the code and the inline comment is filled/replaced with spaces. Tabs used from the beginning of the line to the end of the code remain untouched.
